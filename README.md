# Description of the project

A environmentally themed game where players assume the role of a young environmentalist tasked with cleaning up a virtual environment. The game combines elements of exploration and item collection in a 3D setting, aimed at promoting environmental awareness.The goal is to allow the user to clean up different pollution types with occasional educational facts about the cleaned pollution type.

# How it works
Currently you can only run around in the Hilly Park created map and collect litter. There are a few sound effects upon collection and the character has full movement mechanics.

# List of classes/assets in the project
There are loads of classes in the project. The main ones are listed below:

etc.

# What I am most proud of in the assignment
I worked on this project alone and managed to create several promising mechanics. There is a lot of room for improvmenet, especially regarding the original objective, to add multiple types of pollution, like Air, litter, and water. However, I only had time for littering objects.

Planning and Conceptualization:
Core mechanics
•	Player runs in the map attempting to collect objects (litter) at various locations of the map. Litter could be defined as papers/cans/packets etc. Perhaps other forms of pollution like oil spills and air pollution.
•	Secondary Mechanic - Collecting environmental facts and trivia, which players gather as they clean and explore, educating them about environmental issues.
•	Some collectable trash needs navigation across obstacles, like highpoints etc.
•	The player collects a set number of trash (and bonus) objects in the map to win the game. 
•	We need a player model (human), collection sound, textures of trash/nature etc.
•	Main Goal: Clean and restore the environment in each area to its natural state.   
•	Goals: Teach players about pollution's impact and ways to reduce it.
•	Rewards: Points or achievements for cleaning areas and collecting all environmental facts.
